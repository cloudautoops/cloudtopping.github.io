	<main>
		<p>Cloud automation is the process of using software and tools to automatically manage, provision, and deploy cloud resources. It involves automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as server provisioning, application deployment, and resource scaling, to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.</p>
		<p>Cloud automation can be achieved through various means, such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and CloudFormation, Configuration Management tools like Ansible and Puppet, and Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins and GitLab.</p>
		<p>By leveraging cloud automation, organizations can achieve faster time-to-market, reduce human error, and improve overall system reliability and availability. It enables DevOps teams to focus on higher-level tasks and innovation, rather than manual and repetitive tasks.</p>
