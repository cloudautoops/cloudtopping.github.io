# Cloud Automation

Cloud automation is the process of using software and tools to automatically manage, provision, and deploy cloud resources. It involves automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as server provisioning, application deployment, and resource scaling, to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.

Cloud automation can be achieved through various means, such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and CloudFormation, Configuration Management tools like Ansible and Puppet, and Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins and GitLab.

## Benefits of Cloud Automation

- Improved operational efficiency
- Reduced costs
- Faster time-to-market
- Better system reliability and availability
- Reduced human error
- Increased agility and scalability
